    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>Lasagna is the ultimate culinary hug—a soul-warming Italian classic built on layers of tender pasta, savory meat sauce, and a ridiculous amount of melted cheese. It’s the kind of dish that takes a little patience to assemble but pays you back in leftovers that arguably taste even better the next day.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 diced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>24 oz of marinara sacue</li>
        <li>1 can tomato past</li>
        <li>15 oz ricotta cheese & 1/2 cup of parmesan</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>9-12 lasagana noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Sauce: In a large skillet, brown your meat with the onion and garlic. Drain the excess fat, then stir in the marinara sauce and tomato paste. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes so the flavors get to know each other.</li>
        <li>Mix the Ricotta: In a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta, egg, Parmesan, and a pinch of salt/pepper. This creates that creamy, stable layer that doesn't just slide out when you cut a slice.</li>
        <li>The First Layer: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. This prevents the bottom noodles from sticking.</li>
        <li>The Assembly: Lay down noodles to cover the bottom. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce and a handful of mozzarella. Repeat these layers until you run out of ingredients.</li>
        <li>The Finale: End with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top. Cover with foil (pro tip: spray the foil with oil so the cheese doesn't stick to it!).</li>
        <li>Bake: Cook at 190°C (375°F) for 25 minutes covered, then remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>The Hardest Part: Let it rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing. If you cut it too soon, it will collapse into a (delicious) puddle.</li>
    </ol>
